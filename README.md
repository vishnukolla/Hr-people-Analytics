# Hr-people-Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing a human resources (HR) dataset to uncover meaningful insights about the workforce. The dataset contains 22,214 records across 13 attributes, including employee identifiers, demographic details, hire dates, departmental information, and termination dates where relevant. Originally provided in CSV format, the data was imported into a MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for structured analysis.

Objective
The main goal is to conduct in-depth HR analytics to identify key patterns and trends related to employees. Areas of interest include employee turnover, department-level performance, and tenure trends, with the ultimate aim of generating data-driven recommendations for HR managers and decision-makers.

Dataset Attributes

Employee ID – Unique identifier for each staff member

Age – Current age of the employee

Name – Employee’s full name

Hire Date – Date of onboarding

Department – Business unit or department assigned

Termination Date – End date of employment (if applicable)

Data Preparation
Prior to analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency:

Managing missing values

Converting fields to appropriate data types

Removing duplicate entries

Standardizing formats for consistency

Validating and formatting date fields

Addressing outliers where necessary

Analysis Performed
The project explored the data from multiple angles:

Demographics – Age distribution and workforce composition

Turnover – Termination rates and factors contributing to employee exits

Departmental Insights – Comparative analysis of departments and employee distribution

Tenure – Evaluating employee longevity and its effect on turnover

Time-Based Trends – Patterns in hiring and termination over time

Visualization
The findings were brought to life with Power BI dashboards, featuring bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps to highlight workforce dynamics and departmental performance.

Key Findings

Gender – While men make up a slight majority, the workforce is nearly balanced between male and female employees. A very small fraction identify as gender non-conforming.

Diversity – White employees form the largest racial group, but collectively, people of color outnumber them, indicating a fairly diverse workforce.

Age Groups – Most employees fall between 25–54 years old. Younger employees (18–24) and older employees (55+) make up smaller proportions.

Work Location – Roughly three-quarters of employees are based at headquarters, with the rest distributed across regional sites.

Tenure – Terminated employees stayed an average of 7 years before leaving.

Department Distribution – The engineering department has the largest headcount, followed by accounting. The auditing department has the smallest workforce.

Turnover by Department – The auditing department records the highest turnover rate at 15%.

Geographic Spread – Ohio employs the majority of staff (~14,788), while the remainder are spread evenly across neighboring states.

Hiring vs Termination Trend – Employee terminations have gradually increased, while hiring has dipped slightly but remains relatively stable.

Conclusion
The HR analytics project revealed a workforce that is reasonably balanced in gender and ethnically diverse, with most employees aged between 25 and 54. Headquarters dominates as the primary workplace, while engineering and accounting are the most staffed departments. The auditing department, however, shows the highest attrition rate. Average tenure for terminated employees stands at seven years. Geographically, Ohio holds the bulk of the workforce. Finally, trends suggest a rise in terminations accompanied by a mild slowdown in hiring, which could be a cause for concern.
